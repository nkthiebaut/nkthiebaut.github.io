ðŸ‘‹ I'm based in San Francisco, currently doing Machine Learning at `Hired <https://hired.com/>`_. I've been working in data science for about seven years now, previously at `Visage <https://www.visage.jobs>`_ and `Quantmetry <https://www.quantmetry.com>`_. 
Before that, I've done a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, focused on the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect and Wigner Crystals (`manuscript <https://www.theses.fr/2015PA112050>`_).

I'm interested in Interpretable Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Fair ML, and tech in general. In my day-to-day life I like sport, from surfing to soccer, and I play the piano. ðŸ¤™
