👋 I'm based in San Francisco, currently doing Machine Learning at `Hired (now Vettery) <https://hired.com/>`_. I've been a data scientist for a couple of years now, previously at `Visage <https://www.visage.jobs>`_ and `Quantmetry <https://www.quantmetry.com>`_. 
Those days I'm interested. 👨‍🎓 A few years back I've done PhD in Theoretical Physics, focused on the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect and Wigner Crystals (`manuscript <https://www.theses.fr/2015PA112050>`_).

I'm interested in interpretable machine learning, NLP, and tech in general. In my day-to-day life I like sport, from surfing to muay thai, and I play the piano. 🤙
