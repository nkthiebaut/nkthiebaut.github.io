:summary: Remote work tips and tools

Some tools I find very useful when working remotely (everthing is free unless explicitely stated):

* `Akiflow <https://akiflow.com/>`_: a slick TODO app that allows you to connect multiple tools and create new notes from anywhere with a single keyboard shortcut.
* `Gather <https://www.gather.town/>`_: A virtual office with an 8-bit visual touch.
* `RescueTime <https://www.rescuetime.com/>`_: allows you to track your time and start FocusTime sessions to block all kind of distractions (FocusTime comes with the premium vesion, for $9/month). 
* `Anti-RSI <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/antirsi/id442007571?mt=12>`_: reminds you to look away from the screen every now and then, and to take breaks ($4.99).
* `ScratchWork <https://app.scratchwork.io/>`_ and `Excalidraw <https://excalidraw.com/>`_: the best shared dashboards I've found so far.
* `Don't touch ya face <https://www.donttouchyaface.com/>`_: if you have habits you want to get rid of, try donttouchyaface, it's free and privacy preserving.

Some habits that are even more valuable when working remotely:

* **Meditation**: I highly recommend Sam Harris' app: Waking Up ($15/month, but you can get it for free if you don't have much money and send a nice email). 
* **Sport**: at least once every other day. It doesn't have to be intense, but I need the endorphins.
* **Gratitude journal**: a great way to keep it up is to write daily in a gratitude journal.
