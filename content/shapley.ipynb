    "- **Unrealistic datapoint**: The virtual datapoint that we use to compare our prediction $\\left(x_a=0, x_w=1, x_r=1\\right)$ might not be realistic regarding the data generation process. In that case the model knows nothing about those datapoints and the prediction can be completely random. Note that SHAP - and most approaches in interpretable ML - do not completely solve this problem.\n",
    "- **No importance distribution between correlated variables**: This naive approach is bad at distributing importance among features when there are correlations. For instance if we add a \"Schoolday\" variable that is perfectly correlated with weekday (if we ignore holidays), the machine learning model might use only one of those two variable for its prediction. Still, we want to distribute the importance equally between those two correlated features!  \n",
    "- **Not theoretically grounded**: There are several more desirable properties of explanation methods that are broken by this approach, as we'll see in the rest of this article.\n",

    "## A natural and general explanation framework: feature attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP, LIME, and many others belong to the family of [local interpretation methods](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html). Those methods approximate a complex ML model $f$ with a simpler one $g$ that produces similar results around the data points for which we want to explain the model prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local explanation methods also introduce the concept of *simplified inputs* (denoted with a prime) that ease interpretation: typically, simplified inputs are binary variables corresponding to the presence of features, words or pixels. Those simplified inputs can be (locally) mapped back to original inputs through a mapping function $h_x$. An example might help here: consider a sentiment analysis model that only predicts a 50 % probability for the sentence \"I am happy\" to correspond to positive sentiment. You have to understand why the probability is not larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your input feature $x$ might be a complex embedding of the sentence (e.g. $x=(0.523, 8.35, ...)$), but you can define a simplified input $x'$ such that  $x'=(1, 1, 1)$ corresponds to the presence of the three words \"I\", \"am\" and \"happy\". The mapping function $h_x$ can be any function that would map $x'=(1, 1, 1)$ to $x=(0.523, 8.35, ...)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Local interpretation methods generate *local surrogate models* $g$ that are locally similar to the original model, i.e. such that $g(z')\\simeq f\\left(h_x(z')\\right)$ close to the datapoint being investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the interpretable model $g$, feature attribution consists in distributing the prediction outcome between the different variables:\n",
    "$$ g(z') = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=0}^M \\phi_i z_i'  $$\n",
    "where $z_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our \"I am happy\" example, $\\phi_0$ would be the prediction in the complete absence of words, $\\phi_0+\\phi_1$ would be the local model prediction $g(1,0,0)$ for a virtual example with only the word \"I\", etc.\n",

    "## Shapley values: the most elegant and accurate feature attribution method\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical elegance of the SHAP article comes from the fact that they have listed the desirable properties of additive feature attribution methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. üéØ **Local accuracy**: the explanation model $g$ must give the same prediction has the original model for the untransformed input. This property implies ¬†that the weight $\\phi_i$ sum to the original model prediction $f(x)$ (when added to the prediction of the the null model $\\phi_0$, which is the target mean), i.e. $\\sum_i \\phi_i + \\phi_0 = f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**Missingness**: if a feature is missing the associated weight is 0. This property might seem odd at first. It is only relevant for a dataset with constant features, for which we want the constant feature to have no weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ü¶â**Consistency**: if the effect of adding a feature $x_i$ is larger for a model $f'$ than for another model $f$, the corresponding weight $\\phi_i$ must be larger for $f'$ than for $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that LIME breaks the properties 1 and 3. Indeed, LIME fits the interpretable model $g$ to the original model for a set of points close to the original point $x$, thus you have no guarantee that it produces the same prediction at $x$, hence it does not necessarily respect local accuracy. Similarly, the fit process does not guarantee consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main result of the paper is its only theorem, which states that **the only possible set of weights satisfying the three properties above is given by the Shapley values.**\n",

    "Shapley values are an old, slightly complex, and powerful concept. It comes from games theory as a method to distribute rewards between players in collaborative games. Here the feature values replace the players, and the goal is to determine how the feature values have \"collaborated\" to produce the model prediction (with possible negative contributions to the collaboration).\n",
